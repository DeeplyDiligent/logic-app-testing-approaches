From a requirements perspective, Microsoft aims to empower developers with the ability to execute "Unit Tests" seamlessly on their local machines and within DevOps Pipelines for Logic Apps. This article explores the necessary steps to achieve this goal, primarily focusing on the crucial aspects of mocking dependencies such as Triggers, ServiceBus, External Connections, and APIs. Additionally, the article considers the potential benefits of automating the execution of logic app workflows in UAT/TESTING environments, acknowledging the value of integration testing in the development process.

| (1) | [Logic App Sample Test Framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/integrations-on-azure-blog/automated-testing-with-logic-apps-standard/ba-p/2960623) <br> Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/logicapps/tree/master/LogicAppsSampleTestFramework) | Microsoft | Pros:<br>- Microsoft owned<br>Cons:<br>- Limited support for triggers other than HTTP<br>- Is it being maintained, not much activity?<br>- Tests require logic app to be deployed<br>- No mocking |
| (2) | [Microsoft â€“ Testing workflows with mock data in Azure Logic Apps (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/test-logic-apps-mock-data-static-results?tabs=standard) | Microsoft | Pros:<br>- Good start<br>Cons:<br>- Limited activity support (http only so far) |
| (3) | [Michael Stephensen (integration-playbook.io)](https://www.integration-playbook.io/docs/logic-app-test-manager-1) <br> Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelstephensonuk/IntegrationPlaybook-LogicApp-Standard-Testing) | Michael Stephensen | Pros:<br>- Good approach for targeting Integration Testing requiring workflows to be deployed<br>Cons:<br>- Not Microsoft<br>- No Mocking, therefore no "Unit Testing"<br>- Targets Integration testing only |
| (4) | [LogicApp Unit Testing](https://github.com/LogicAppUnit/TestingFramework/wiki) <br> Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/LogicAppUnit/TestingFramework) | Mark Abrams | Pros:<br>- Seems to align with what we are trying to achieve: Unit Testing, Mocking, Pipelines<br>- Recent git activity<br>Cons:<br>- Not Microsoft |
